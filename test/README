This is a test to generate the set of residue-residue contacts for a trajectory of dihydrofolate reductase.
File prot.top is an AMBER topology file
File prot.dcd is a dcd AMBER trajectory file containing ten frames

To generate the list of contact maps, first add the parent directory to PYTHONPATH:
In the Bash shell:  PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/my_path_to_the_files/ContactMapAnalysis

python test.py ContactMap --kwargs "job=generate residue ContactMaps,rowSelection=resid 1-161 and not name H*,cutOff=4.0,PSFile=prot.top,trajfile=prot.dcd,outf=protCml.hd5"

Excerpt from MDAnalisis.core.AtomGroup.py regarding PSFile and trajfile:
"""The system always requires a *topology* file --- in the simplest case just a list of atoms.
   This can be a CHARMM/NAMD PSF file or a simple coordinate file with atom informations such
   as PDB, Gromacs GRO, or CHARMM CRD. See :ref:`Supported topology formats` for what kind of
   topologies can be read.

   A trajectory provides coordinates; the coordinates have to be ordered in the same way as the
   list of atoms in the topology. A trajectory can be a single frame such as a PDB, CRD, or GRO
   file, or it can be a MD trajectory (in CHARMM/NAMD/LAMMPS DCD, Gromacs XTC/TRR, or generic
   XYZ format).  See :ref:`Supported coordinate formats` for what can be read as a "trajectory".

   As a special case, when the topology is a PDB, GRO or CRD file then the coordinates are
   immediately loaded from the "topology" file unless a trajectory is supplied.
"""

The output file, protCml.hd5 is a binary HDF5 file. To view its contents, use an application
such as 'hdfview'. Here follows a description of the file contents:
There are ten folders, corresponding to each of the ten frames.
Each frame folder contains a contact map distributed as three sets of data, named 'col', 'row',
and 'data'. Figure 'screenshot.jpg' contains a screenshot of these sets for folder 00003. For instance,
index 14 (highlighted in red in the figure) means that residues 109 ('column' residue) and 2 ('row' residue)
have 1 contact ('data'). Thus, each index gives onw pair of residues in contact. We do not list the pairs of
residues that are not in contact.

To generate the number of contacts, execute:

python test.py ContactMap --kwargs "job=number of atomic contacts,inFile=protCml.hd5,outFile=nContacts.dat"
